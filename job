kubernetes job -  when the job should be there unitl its completed

suppose if the pod is deleted it will recreate the again until the job should be execute

if the pod fails the job will run another pod until the  job should be execute

completions(non parrallel) -  if you specify 2 it will execute 2 jobs one after another

parallelism - if you specify 2 it will execute 2 jobs at a same time

backofflimit --  if you specify 3 , the iteration wil occur 4 pod fails then it will stops the job

activedeadlineseconds --- i dont want the job to long runner if you specify the time limit the time limit excedes then it will not run 



cronjob --- it will run the job on the  specific time


successfuljobhistorylimit  ---- if u specify 2 the 2 succesfull jobs will be there

failedjobhistorylimit --- f u specify 2 the 2 failed  jobs will be there



suspend if you specify true the job will be suspend



how to delete jobs automatic
in the job spec ttlsecafterfinishedjobs: 10
aftercjob completion it will wait 10 sec then the job will delete





init container - init container runs before the actual container run . if th init container sucessfull executed then only process with actual container. if the init container fails it will not start actual container , if fails it will restart the init container again

if you have multiple init  container it will start the sequences one init container another


pause container -pause container is the container that hold all the containers of a pod together
pause container is always created before the mai container

pause container is infrastracure container whose sole purpose to all these namespaces

all user defined containers of the pod then use the namespace of the pod infrastracure container

when u stop pause container the kubernetes detects the pod is unhealty and it will recreate again the pod then ipaddress will change

when u stop main container it will not affect to pod but restart increment no ipaddress will change
